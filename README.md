# StochasticEnsembleSSL

This repo contains the code for the paper "Semi-Supervised Learning by Disentangling and Self-Ensembling over Stochastic Latent Space" accepted at MICCAI 2019. [[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09607)]

## Description
The code comprises of training VAE and using the stochastic latent representation of the trained VAE to train ensemble SSL model. The code can be easily modified to directly pass the data into ensemble SSL model.
